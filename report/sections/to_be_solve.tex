In the begin I will list all the problems that I had to solve in order to
implement the spline-based trajectory generation for the quadruped robot:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Communication the python code with the Mujoco simulation environment.
    
    \item Implementing the inverse kinematics for the Unitree GO2 robot to convert
    desired foot positions into joint angles.

    \item Developing the spline trajectory.
    
    \item Implement phase generation for the walking gait to coordinate leg movements.

    \item Implement PID controller to balance the robot and maintain stability.

\end{itemize}
