Algorithm ended up beeing very successful. Robot is able to walk
smoothly on a flat terrain. What was more suprising is that robot is also able to
walk on an uneven terrain with small obstacles. The PID balancing controller
helped a lot with maintaining stability during walking.

Another practical implementation could be robots walking in a theme parks
by tweeking the gait parameters it is easy to achieve funny walking styles.
Overall, the spline-based trajectory generation approach proved to be
effective for controlling the quadruped robot's walking gait in simulation.

Robots like that arleady exists in a Disney theme park, from available information
their approach uses reinforcement learning to train the walking gait.
Figure~\ref{fig:disney-bipedal} shows a bipedal robot. Same approach is implemented
by Jan Górski.

\subsection{Comparision to between Splines and RL algorithms}
Both spline-based trajectory generation and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches
have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to controlling quadruped
robot locomotion. Key difference is that spline-based approach is simpler to implement
and requires computing power of medium size calculator while RL approach requires
a lot of computing power to train the model and then run model in real-time. Despite 
this difference spline approach can be expanded and achieve similar results to RL approach.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning [Jan Górski]}
This method involves training a neural network to learn optimal walking gaits
through trial and error. The robot receives rewards for successful movements and
penalties for failures, allowing it to gradually improve its performance over time.
To train the RL model Jan used SDU UCloud computing resources. Even with dedicated
GPU it took several hours to train the model. Researches from ETH Zürich 
\cite{deep-tracking-control} have demonstrated that RL approach can achieve
impressive results in quadruped locomotion, including walking on very challenging terrain. 
A video demonstrating their results can be found at \cite{deep-tracking-control-video}. 

\subsection{Spline foot trajectory}
My approach is based on generating smooth foot trajectories using cubic splines.
This method does not require high computing power nor require training. However,
witch a proper tuning and additional modules witch modifies the foot trajectory 
in real-time it can achieve similar results to RL approach. Researchers from Brazil
\cite{pedro2024quadruped} have demonstrated that spline-based trajectory generation
can be effective for controlling quadruped robots, including walking on uneven terrain.
Great advatange of spline approach is that it is predictable and stable. It is 
just a math function that could be analyzed and prooved to be stable.
