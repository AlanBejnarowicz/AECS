To make robot more stable during walking I implemented a PID controller
to adjust the body orientation based on IMU data from the simulation. The controller
calculates the error between the desired and actual orientation and computes
the necessary adjustments witch are then applied to legs Z axis positions. 
That simple way to help maintain balance during walking and reduce body
tilting happend to be very effective.

To balance in both pitch and roll axes I implemented two separate PD controllers.
The PD parameters were tuned through trial and error to achieve optimal performance.
Whole control loop runs at DT = 0.002s.
