Our interest in a quadruped robot locomotion cames from our previous project. 
During our bachelor studies we built a quadrupedal robot that was able to walk using
a simple predefined gait. However, the robot's movement was jerky and lacked smoothness,
mostly because of used motors.

This project is a nice opportunity to explore more about walking algorithms
for quadruped robots. We want to focus on generating smooth trajectories for the robot's legs
using spline interpolation techniques.
